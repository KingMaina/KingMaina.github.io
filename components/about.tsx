            <p className="text-xl text-gray-400">When I was young, I enjoyed playing Wolfenstein 3D, Doom 64, Dangerous Dave etc. and I was alwys curious as to how those games were made.
              Fast forward 2-3 decades and here I am learning on how to do it, just a little bit the old fashioned way in the technologies.
            </p>
            <p className='text-xl text-gray-400'>This project has taught me a lot about how game development works from planning for the project, learning concepts all the way to development and testing.
              This may not break headlines as the most innovative game ever but it's a start for me and hopefully in the coming years I will improve on this game further.</p>
